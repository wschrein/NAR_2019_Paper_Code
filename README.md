**This code is used to filter out Downstream of Genes (DoGs) found from aberrant transcription.** 

DoGs were first documented in Vilborg _et al_. This code identifies DoGs that read into the downstream gene on the same strand. This code makes use of some annotation files from wormbase.org (ftp://ftp.wormbase.org/pub/wormbase/).

Identify DoGs and Figure1 contains the code used to identify failure of pol II to terminate transcription and used to filter out these reads.
